## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to analyze the UFO sightings data and allow users to filter for one to five criteria. The criteria for searching the UFO dataset is the 1) date, 2) city, 3) state, 4) country, and 5) shape of the UFO sightings. The index.html file contains the code for the layout of the UFO webpage. The app.js file contains the javascript code that saves the element, value, and id of the filters that were changed. There is also an event listener in the app.js file to detect changes to each filter. Finally, a function was created in the app.js file to loop through all of the filters and keep any data that matches the filter values. The UFO webpage is a user-friendly site that correctly filters the original table based on user input.
